# External wordpress posts

This is only a "patch" for myself from [![WordPress](https://github.com/hideokamoto/wpapi-shortcodes-and-widgets)]

It includes a small "cache" for replies and other things.

This script is "dedicated" to download posts from external wordpress trhough native API (with json).
